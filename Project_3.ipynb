    "- **Create and compare two or more models**. One of these must be a random forest, however the other can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook(s) with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists\n",
    "- An executive summary of your results\n",
    "- A 8 to 10 minute presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience. The reason we say 'semi-technical' is that FiveThirtyEight wants to see how you plan to explain your findings in your article, and their audience is likely readers who are familiar with and interested in data/statistics, but are not experts. This means that if you'd like to talk about your model works you can, but explain what exactly your model does at a high level.\n",

    "**Part 1** of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you will need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL. There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but often scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).\n",
